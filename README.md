# LavendAid
LavendAid is a company that leverages innovative technology and research to prevent sexual violence in communities. We strive to raise awareness, provide aid, and promote accountability for this issue. Our first product is A.L.E.R.T, Assistive Locket for Emergency Response and Tracking that can trigger an emergency app on an iPhone when the user is in danger.
